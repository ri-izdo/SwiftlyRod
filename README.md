\f0\fs24 \cf0 Motion, Data & Interactive Systems\
\
This prototype was developed as part of my interview process for the **Staff Design Technologist** role at Strava. It demonstrates how I approach systems thinking, motion design, and interactive prototyping across platforms.\
\
## \uc0\u55358 \u56813  Purpose\
\
Due to NDA restrictions with prior work at Apple, this prototype was created from scratch to reflect my design-engineering process in an open, transparent way. The goal was to:\
\
- Explore user-centered motion design using [Rive](https://rive.app) and [Spline](https://spline.design/)\
- Translate HealthKit/Strava-style data into clear, meaningful visualizations\
- Prototype cross-platform interactions using SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose\
- Tell a story about fitness, recovery, and momentum through design\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u57056  Features\
\
### SwiftUI Experience (iOS/macOS)\
- **Live step data visualization** using Charts and animated dot tracking\
- **Splash screen experience** combining `Rive` animation and layered transitions\
- **Award system grid UI** with animated state-based interactions\
- **Rest Day vs Workout Grid** calendar visualization using Strava-style color logic\
\
### Android Simulation (Jetpack Compose)\
- A quick prototype (built in ~30 minutes) that visualizes raw daily step data using Android layout and Compose primitives\
- Demonstrates transferable logic from SwiftUI to Jetpack\
- Reflects interest and adaptability to Android systems\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56520  Technologies Used\
\
- SwiftUI (iOS/macOS)\
- Jetpack Compose (Android preview)\
- Rive for motion-driven UI\
- Spline for spatial 3D interaction design\
- HealthKit-style mock data\
- Custom transition animations, gradients, and interaction modeling\
\
## \uc0\u55356 \u57263  Intent\
\
This prototype isn't meant to replicate production work \'97 it\'92s a **conceptual demonstration** of how I approach complex problems with clarity, motion, and empathy. It's also a gesture of respect toward Strava\'92s mission of celebrating activity and connection through thoughtful, data-informed design.\
