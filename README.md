# Summary
This prototype started as a fun, weekend exploration — a hobby project to investigate how live fitness data could be turned into something more interactive and emotionally engaging. It connects to Apple HealthKit and the Strava API to pull real activity data like steps, workouts, and recovery patterns, then visualizes that information through animated charts, motion graphics, and playful UI.
Along the way, I incorporated tools like SwiftUI, Rive, and Spline to bring moments of 
delight and movement into the experience. While the project was purely exploratory, it was 
a great way to combine my interests in fitness, storytelling, and systems-driven design — 
all with a nod to the kind of thoughtful engagement Strava already excels at.

## Features

### SwiftUI Experience (iOS/macOS)
- **Strava API & HealthKit** data for fitness updates
- **Live step data visualization** using Charts and animated dot tracking
- **Splash screen experience** combining `Rive` animation and layered transitions
- **Award system grid UI** with animated state-based interactions


## Technologies Used

- SwiftUI (iOS)
- Rive for motion-driven UI
- Spline for spatial 3D interaction design
- HealthKit-style mock data
- Custom transition animations, gradients, and interaction modeling

## Intent

This prototype isn't meant to replicate production work — it’s a **conceptual demonstration** of how I approach complex problems with clarity, motion, and empathy. It's also a gesture of respect toward Strava’s mission of celebrating activity and connection through thoughtful, data-informed design.
