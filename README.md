# Motion, Data & Interactive Systems

This prototype was developed as part of my interview process for the **Staff Design Technologist** role at Strava. It demonstrates how I approach systems thinking, motion design, and interactive prototyping across platforms.

## Features

### SwiftUI Experience (iOS/macOS)
- **Live step data visualization** using Charts and animated dot tracking
- **Splash screen experience** combining `Rive` animation and layered transitions
- **Award system grid UI** with animated state-based interactions
- **Rest Day vs Workout Grid** calendar visualization using Strava-style color logic


## Technologies Used

- SwiftUI (iOS/macOS)
- Rive for motion-driven UI
- Spline for spatial 3D interaction design
- HealthKit-style mock data
- Custom transition animations, gradients, and interaction modeling

## Intent

This prototype isn't meant to replicate production work — it’s a **conceptual demonstration** of how I approach complex problems with clarity, motion, and empathy. It's also a gesture of respect toward Strava’s mission of celebrating activity and connection through thoughtful, data-informed design.
